# NWM
This is an app that uses Express Node.js for a simple server-side fetching graphQL data from a public API and then relaying that data through a REST API to a React client-side.

### Running the code
Go to the server directory and run:

```
npm start
```

then go to the client and run the same command. The app should be visible at `localhost:3000`.
